# DevOpsSync
Current problem faced by DevOps Users:
1) The remaining work for work Items has to be manually set to 0 when the work Item is closed or resolved.
2) The remaining work for work Items has to be manually set depending on the remaining work of the child feature(s)/requirement(s).
3) The State of the parent feature/requirement has to be manually set depending on the state of the child feature(s)/requirement(s).

This Repos tries to solve the above mentioned problems Using Java. Please free to use the above code to further automate your DevOps operational effort.

Also the programs use a google sheet as a configuration file (to pick which projects to automate). Here is a sample sheet:
